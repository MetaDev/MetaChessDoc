The editor classes + metaconstant + metamodels are used to initialise the various models and constants to make the game work
the editor classes will also be used to later when a more extended gui is implemented, edit the models
graphic classes are models that contain all graphical data
render classes interact with opengl classes to draw all kinds of objects
the action package contains: MetaAction, MetaActionRange, MetaActionActivity classes
MetaAction: is a model for alle different actions a piece can make based on a certain input.
MetaActionRange:  is a class that returns all tiles on which the a metaAction can be active
MetaActionActivity: is class which returns if a metaAction is still active

A MetaAction can be ranged or not, decided whether it has a MetaActionRange or not
if ranged the MetaAction does not execute when it's activating conditions are met.
It checks it's range it saves it on the board. if the a piece steps on the tile with the MetaAction saved on it, then this MetaAction is executed on the piece.
Every MetaAction can only be activated once on a piece

In a piece you have 2 lists of MetaAction 1 to note if the MetaAxtions are currently active on the model, an other to save if a cooldown is running
for an EXECUTABLE MetaAction. So if a MetaAction is not in this list, this piece can't execute it himself. It can however be applied to it.
That's saved in the other list which can contain any MetaAction
