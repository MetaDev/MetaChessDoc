a special attack is a convention between pieces, it's not an attack more just a special
it is by no means bound to the game and they can be turned off

a special attack counts as a move, a special attack applies to both sides (but can apply only on certain types), if both sides use the oppisit specatt then the effect is negated
if they use the same it depends on the attack maybe nothing maybe strong

in the rpg world, all special attack are generic and can only be learned by catching the grey pawn

in the moba all specatts are available depending on your piece, generic specatt's are more expensive then specific specatts
-> like a chain movement up,down,left or more specific the 'snake' leftup, rightup
board specatt can apply only on your own tile, all neighbouring tiles, all sibling tiles,...

only x specatt can be applied at a time, this x is different for different levels of specatts
e.g. a level 0 can be applied as many times as you want, a level 3 only every 10 sec's, that's for switch specatt's (on or off)
there not only different levels but also different types (switch, numerical, ...) and different ranges of application (own tile, all sibling tiles, ...)

-slippery tile, move one or more tiles further then intended 
-additive range, which means that range can be larger then 9 but also 9+5 by pressing both numbers
-the piece should loose it's remaining movement if leaving a tile to another which has lower fraction, because of the difference in decision-time
-> maybe this can be turned off with a very rare ability
-(possiblity to have a shield that is positioned with position buttons so protects that side (maybe))
-in a game different fractions can apply, this is a special attack of the pawn, only fraction's who are a power of 2 are allowed (rule)
-each player can choose a type when beginning game, this can be changed to random by pawns 
-type is visble even when on matching color tile, this can be turned off by only giving the core an opposite color for drawing
-you have type invisibility (hide ornaments), you have total invisibility (hide ornaments and core)
-(default, but the specatt can be to turn it off) hoover (1,2,3)(ignore fractioning tile for movement (if movement illegal move)(stay on same fractioning level))
-change directions
-invert(fake) color
-promotion(or fake)
-cloak
-en passant
-schuine aanval
-allowed to make more (or less) movements in 1 turn
-first move (beweeg 2 kotjes ipv 1)
-aan en uitzetten vn schaduw voor een stuk
-retreat (move away an x amount of tiles in a random direction) -> for the pawn and the king
-the tiles you jump over can't be acces for 10 turn s -> horse
-continuous movement over tiles
-confusion: disco fever: change opponent color mapping (randomly); mosquito: let a mosquito sound play when a piece comes to close of another player


specatts are divided by level for direction and range, some specatt's are level 0 which means that every piece can use them, some specatt's
can even be called all the time, this makes them more like options
