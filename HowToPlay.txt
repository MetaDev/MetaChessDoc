Special moves
------------

change amount of tiles made with movement: numpad 1,2,3,4,5,6
range is default 1
range is additive: holding numpad 1 and 3 results in : 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 range

when a king moves onto a pawn of it's own side the pawn is bound to the king and moves with it as a defending wall
to remove a pawn from the wall a player has to take back control

pressing 0 on the numpad moves the player to another piece

Piece specific moves
---------

these are activated by holding the space bar, they have a cooldown equal to number of turns active but relative to tile fraction

Pawn: Turn, change direction of pawn which makes it possible to move in 4 orthogonal directions

Bischop: Rogue, can jump through pieces and penetrate lower fraction tiles, hide type , different levels

Rook: Horizon, double the number of tile diameter the piece can see

Knight: Dragon, can kill a piece when jumping over it, also jumps over fractioned tiles and can kill pieces 1 fraction deep

King: Command, change the head position of the wall of pawns surrounding the king, if the king has no wall command shifts the balance of his influence

Queen: None, strong enough already bitch

Interface
---------------------------

left are the cooldown and turns active of a special move as well as the range and the piece type

right on top are team lives and down is the turn, when the bar is vertical it's your turn to move

Logic
-----------------------
The smaller the tile, the shorter the turns are, faster turn-rate.
once a certain threshold is reached the game's no longer turn-based but real-time
